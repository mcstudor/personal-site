# Extra-Curricular Activities

## Technology Commercialization Academy

> Location: Spokane, WA
>
> Dates: June 2019 to August 2019
>
> Description: Worked with fellow students to develop a startup proposal based around Eastern Washington University technology. Our team worked on an application called Magpie. Magpie is an Android application that allows users to follow self-guided tours and explore urban environments. It was originally developed by other student teams at Eastern. I worked as both project manager and software developer.
>
> As the project manager, I coordinated my team of four in market research and business planning. We preformed interviews for business collaborations, created presentations and delivered a working prototype of the application.
>
> As the software developer, I updated and fixed the Android application and setup a server and database for the application. I also contracted one other developer to assist me to deliver on time. The application was written in Java using Android Studio and our server was written in Node.js with a MySql database.
